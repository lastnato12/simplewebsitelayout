                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts

                <h2>Javascript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web
